# Collie Tests

This workspace hosts exploratory end-to-end style harnesses for Collie. It wires Vitest-based smoke tests, CLI runners, and TypeScript analysis helpers that operate on small fixture projects.

> **Note:** All files here are scaffolding only; actual test logic will be added in follow-up phases.
