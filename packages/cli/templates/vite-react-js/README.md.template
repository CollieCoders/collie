This project was scaffolded with `collie create` using the Vite + React + JavaScript template.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` (or your chosen package manager) – start the dev server
- `npm run build` – create a production build
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build

## Collie

`src/components/Welcome.collie` is an example Collie component. Import `.collie` files just like React components and they will be compiled during your build.
